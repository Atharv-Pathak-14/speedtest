# Speed Test

A self-hosted, lightweight speed test implemented in JavaScript, and based on [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## Compatibility

| Chrome | Edge | Firefox | IE | Opera | Safari | 
|--------|------|---------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| 43     | *    | 48.0    | 11 | 12.10 | 6.0    |

## Features

* IP Address (with ISP) detection
* Latency and jitter tests
* Download and upload bandwidth tests over 1 Gbps

## Requirements

* Some decent server CPU
* Using HTTPS is highly discouraged, adding an heavy packet size and computing overhead
* Using server compression is also discouraged, adding a computing overhead

## Run

### Docker container from registry

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 e7db/speedtest
```

Available versions:
| Server language  | Tags             |
|------------------|------------------|
| Go               | `go`             |
| NodeJS (default) | `node`, `latest` |
| PHP              | `php`            |

### Self-hosted server

Having cloned this repository, you can launch the speed test on your server in different flavors.

First, you will want to compile the web UI using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM.

```sh
cd web
npm run prod
```

Then, different server technologies are available to run the backend side.

#### Go
```sh
cd server/go
go build -o server server.go
./server 80 ../../web/dist
```

#### NodeJS
```sh
cd server/node
npm install
node server.js 80 ../../web/dist
```

#### PHP
```sh
cd server/php
php -S 0.0.0.0:80 -t ../../web/dist server.php
```

### Custom server script

You may also run a server based on your own backend script. You should comply to the following routes, for the web UI to work properly: 
| Endpoint  | Arguments           | Expected behavior         |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| /ip       |                     | Returns the user IP       |
| /ping     |                     | Returns an empty response |
| /upload   |                     | Returns an empty response |
| /download | `size`, `chunkSize` | Returns binary data as long as `size`, with chunks of `chunkSize` |
