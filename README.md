# Speed Test

A self-hosted, lightweight speed test implemented in JavaScript, and based on [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## Compatibility

| Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari |
|--------|------|---------|-------|--------|
| 43     | *    | 48.0    | 12.10 | 6.0    |

## Features

* IP Address (with ISP) detection
* Latency and jitter tests
* Download and upload bandwidth tests

## Requirements

* Some decent server CPU
* Using HTTPS is highly discouraged, adding an heavy packet size and computing overhead
* Using server compression is also discouraged, adding a computing overhead

## Run

### Docker container from registry

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 e7db/speedtest
```

To store results permanently, you need a volume:
```sh
docker volume create speedtest_results
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 -v speedtest_results:/app/results e7db/speedtest
```
Note: Results are never cleaned automatically.

### Self-hosted server

Having cloned this repository, you can launch the speed test on your server in different flavors.

First, you will want to compile the web UI using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM.

```sh
cd web
npm run dist
```

Then, prepare dependencies and run the server.


```sh
cd server
npm install
node server.js 80 ../web/dist
```

### Custom server script

You may also run a server based on your own backend script. You should comply to the following routes, for the web UI to work properly:

| Endpoint    | Method | Arguments           | Expected behavior                                                                              |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/ip`       | GET    |                     | Returns a JSON formatted object with the user IP information (i.e., `{ip: 'xxx'}`)             |
| `/ping`     | GET    |                     | Returns an empty response                                                                      |
| `/upload`   | GET    |                     | Returns an empty response                                                                      |
| `/download` | GET    | `size`, `chunkSize` | Returns binary data as long as `size`, with chunks of `chunkSize`                              |
| `/save`     | POST   |                     | Accepts a JSON payload with the results to save, returns an UUID corresponding to this results |
