# Speed Test

A self-hosted, lightweight speed test implemented in JavaScript, and based on [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## Demo

A demo is available here, running on a Digital Ocean server based on Amsterdam:

- stable: [http://134.209.196.181:8080](http://134.209.196.181:8080)
- develop: [http://134.209.196.181:8081](http://134.209.196.181:8081)

## Usage

### Compatibility

| Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 43     | \*   | 48.0    | 12.10 | 6.0    |

### Features

- IP Address (with ISP) detection
- Latency and jitter tests
- Download and upload bandwidth tests

### Requirements

- Some decent server CPU
- Using HTTPS is highly discouraged, adding an heavy packet size and computing overhead
- Using server compression is also discouraged, adding a computing overhead

### Configuration

You can configure the speed test server following your needs. Find below the list of configurable options through the file `config.json` available at the root level of the server.  
The key corresponds to the JSON path where to affect the value. For example, setting the value `2000` for the key `download.delay` corresponds to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "download": {
    "delay": 2000
  }
}
```

### Docker

[![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/e7db/speedtest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/e7db/speedtest)

#### Run the Speed Test container

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 e7db/speedtest
```

#### Store the results permanently

To store results permanently, you need a volume:

```sh
docker volume create speedtest_results
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 -v speedtest_results:/app/results e7db/speedtest
```

**Note:** Results are never cleaned automatically, used space will grow over time.

#### Use a custom configuration

To use a custom configuration through the `config.json` file, mount it through a read-only volume:

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 -v /path/to/config.json:/app/web/config.json:ro e7db/speedtest
```

### Self-hosted server

Having cloned this repository, you can launch the speed test on your server in different flavors.

First, you will want to compile the web UI using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM.

```sh
cd packages/web
npm ci
npm run dist
```

Then, prepare dependencies and run the server.

```sh
cd packages/server
npm ci --production
node server.js 80 ../web/dist
```
