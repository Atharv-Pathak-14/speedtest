## Compatibility

| Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari |
|--------|------|---------|-------|--------|
| 43     | *    | 48.0    | 12.10 | 6.0    |

## Features

* IP Address (with ISP) detection
* Latency and jitter tests
* Download and upload bandwidth tests

## Requirements

* Some decent server CPU
* Using HTTPS is highly discouraged, adding an heavy packet size and computing overhead
* Using server compression is also discouraged, adding a computing overhead

## Usage

### Docker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/e7db/speedtest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/e7db/speedtest)
[![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/e7db/speedtest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/e7db/speedtest)

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 e7db/speedtest
```

To store results permanently, you need a volume:
```sh
docker volume create speedtest_results
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 -v speedtest_results:/app/results e7db/speedtest
```
Note: Results are never cleaned automatically.

### Self-hosted server

Having cloned this repository, you can launch the speed test on your server in different flavors.

First, you will want to compile the web UI using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM.

```sh
cd packages/web
npm ci
npm run dist
```

Then, prepare dependencies and run the server.

```sh
cd packages/server
npm ci --production
node server.js 80 ../web/dist
```

## Support the project

You want to support the project? A speed test requires a server with high bandwidth. With Patreon, Paypal or cryprocurrencies, you can help me cover the fees!
